IDC LICENSE 1.0
This license is for people who want to share their work but literally cannot be bothered to manage it. By using this software/material, you agree that the author has reached a state of total indifference regarding your life choices.

You are hereby granted permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, or even perform a ritual sacrifice with this software. Do whatever you want. Seriously. We don’t care.

The work is provided "AS IS". If this code:

    Deletes your database

    Sets your CPU on fire

    Causes your partner to leave you

    Starts a global uprising of sentient toasters

That is your problem. The author is not liable for your poor technical decisions or the inevitable heat death of the universe. There is NO WARRANTY, express or implied.

If any part of this license is deemed legally invalid, the remaining parts still apply.
